**Summary**: This is a game I developed that allows the player to play my own version of the "Google Endless Runner Game" using hand-gestures. It uses a pre-trained ML model from the Python MediaPipe framework and an OpenCV camera stream to allow the system to recognize "thumbs up" and "thumbs down" gestures, corresponding to the dino's "jump" and "duck" movements respectively. The game itself was created using the PyGame framework.

**Instructions to Play**: First, clone the repository. Then install the following libraries: mediapipe, numpy, cv2, pygame. Running the "gesture_controlled_dino_game.py" file should open the game in a separate window.
